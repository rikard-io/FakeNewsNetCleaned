He is to sign an executive order to this effect this week.\nIn an interview with Fox News, President Trump described Indians living in the USA as lawless warriors with a history of attacking and killing US citizens. He claimed, \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can\u2019t trust these Indians.\u201d\nPresident Trump consulted with the appropriate members of the government and found that most Indians do not possess the relevant immigration documents. \u201cThat means they are here illegally. I had to act.\u201d\nFurther criticism is to be found on the President\u2019s Twitter account:\nHe also tweeted:\nThe White House has announced that Indians will be given a three month period in which to leave the country. India is to pay for their flights.\n\nSource:the-postillon.com", "publish_date": 1493092800000, "pubdate": "April 25, 2017", "canonical_link": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/2017/04/25/trump-wants-to-deport-american-indians-to-india/", "url": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/2017/04/25/trump-wants-to-deport-american-indians-to-india/", "source": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us", "top_img": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dsadasdasd-300x169.png", "authors": "[]", "keywords": "[]", "meta_data": {"description": "I Love Native Americans", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.4.1 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "I Love Native Americans", "description": "I Love Native Americans", "title": "I Love Native Americans", "locale": "en", "url": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/2017/04/25/trump-wants-to-deport-american-indians-to-india/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/2017/04/25/trump-wants-to-deport-american-indians-to-india/", "description": "I Love Native Americans", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "I Love Native Americans"}, "fb": {"pages": 1528274573849303, "op-recirculation-ads": "placement_id=138056310093504_140128016553000"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-17500549_733861513446924_138651442_o-270x270.png", "ia": {"markup_url": "http://ilovenativeamericans.us/mystery-behind-letter-x-on-your-palms-only-3-people-in-the-world-have-it/?ia_markup=1"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "images": "['http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/59cc126b8e178237abce82915581cfca_1486033453-100x75.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/enfantt-620x400-620x381-300x160.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fruitvliegjes-100x75.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/59cc126b8e178237abce82915581cfca_1486033453-300x160.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sperm-whale-100x75.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/roasted-garlic-1-300x160.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sperm-whale-300x160.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/funn-300x160.png', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sdasdaweqqsdeqasdadqwasdasdqw.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fruitvliegjes-300x160.jpg', 'http://ilovenativeamericans.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dsadasdasd-300x169.png']", "summary": "", "movies": "[]"}
